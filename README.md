# Pokedex

This app was created using the PokeAPI. I made this as a way to practice working with api's and the fetch api. This was originally based of a tutorial by Fidal Mathew which can be found [here](https://dev.to/fidalmathew/build-pokemon-finder-using-react-and-pokeapi-5b5k). I expanded upon this tutorial to add the back, random, and next buttons as well as all the styling seen.

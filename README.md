# Pokedex

This app was created using the PokeAPI. I made this as a way to practice working with api's and the fetch api. 

This was originally based of a tutorial by Fidal Mathew which can be found [here](https://dev.to/fidalmathew/build-pokemon-finder-using-react-and-pokeapi-5b5k). 

I expanded upon this tutorial by adding the back, random, and next buttons, all the styling seen and a photo carousel to showcase the pokemon.

I completely rebuilt the fetching functionality of this app without following along to the tutorial. This was to reinforce the skills I learned from the tutorial. The functionality works exactly the same but I built it completely solo.
